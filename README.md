## Java Programming
![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-DC143C?style=flat-squaree&logo=java&logoColor=white)
- **Description**: A collection of Java programming projects and learning modules exploring essential concepts including variables, objects, control flows, exception handling, design
class diagrams and object-oriented programming principles. Assessment 1: Rolling Project was a two-part assessment to develop a simple University Enrollment Program. The Capstone Assessment 2: Java Jumper required the development of a Simple Video Game, and the video presentation can be found at the [Youtube Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDigYY18HOc)

![Linux & Networking](https://img.shields.io/badge/Linux_&_Networking-0078D6?style=flat-square&logo=linux&logoColor=white)
- **Description**: This module covers the Linux operating system, signal modulation, network architecture, and the TCP/IP (OSI) model. 
    Assessments include creating modulation and constellation diagrams with Desmos, analyzing network traffic with Wireshark, and a final practical assessment using the Core Network Simulator to configure network devices including static routing, VLAN segmentation, and firewall configuration.


## Introduction to Databases
