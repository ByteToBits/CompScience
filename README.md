## Java Programming
![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-DC143C?style=flat-squaree&logo=java&logoColor=white)
- **Description**: This module focuses on Java Programming covering essential concepts such as variables, objects, control flows, exception handling, class diagram design, and object-oriented programming principles. Key assessments included the "Rolling Project," a two-part task to develop a University Enrollment Program, and the capstone project "Java Jumper," a simple video game demonstrated in this[Youtube Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDigYY18HOc)

## Architecture and Networks

![Linux & Networking](https://img.shields.io/badge/Linux_&_Networking-0078D6?style=flat-square&logo=linux&logoColor=white)
- **Description**: This module explores Linux OS fundamentals, signal modulation, network architectures, and the TCP/IP (OSI) model. Assessments involved creating modulation and constellation diagrams in Desmos, analyzing network traffic with Wireshark, and performing practical network configurations—including static routing, VLAN segmentation, and firewall setup—using the Core Network Simulator.


## Introduction to Databases

![MongoDB](https://img.shields.io/badge/MongoDB-4EA94B?style=flat-squaree&logo=mongodb&logoColor=white)
- **Description**: This module focuses on database design, modeling, and querying using Oracle SQL Database and Oracle Data Modeler, alongside an introduction to non-relational databases through MongoDB. Assessments covered Database Design Theory and practical SQL/NoSQL implementations using Oracle SQL Database and MongoDB.
