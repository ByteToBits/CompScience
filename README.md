## Java Programming
![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-ED8B00?style=for-the-badge&logo=java&logoColor=white)
- **Description**: A collection of Java programming projects and learning modules exploring essential concepts including variables, objects, control flows, exception handling and object oriented programming. There are two major practical assessments: the progressive "Rolling Project" that builds skills incrementally, and the capstone "Java Jumper" project which is to develop a simple video game.

![Linux & Networking](https://img.shields.io/badge/Linux_&_Networking-0078D6?style=flat-square&logo=linux&logoColor=white)
- **Description**: This module covers the Linux operating system, signal modulation, network architecture, and the TCP/IP (OSI) model. 
    Assessments include creating modulation and constellation diagrams with Desmos, analyzing network traffic with Wireshark, and a final practical assessment using the Core Network Simulator to configure network devices including static routing, VLAN segmentation, and firewall configuration.


## Introduction to Databases

![MongoDB](https://img.shields.io/badge/MongoDB-4EA94B?style=for-the-badge&logo=mongodb&logoColor=white)
- **Description**: This module covers database design and modeling using Oracle SQL Database and Oracle Data Modeler, 
   SQL programming for database querying and management, and an introduction to non-relational databases through MongoDB. 
   Assessments include Database Design Theory and SQL/NoSQL implementation using Oracle SQL Database and MongoDB.
