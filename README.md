## Java Programming
- **Description**: Object-oriented programming covering variables, objects, control flows, exception handling, and class diagram design. Key projects included the "Rolling Project" (University Enrollment System) and capstone project "Java Jumper" game ([Demo Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDigYY18HOc)).

## Architecture and Networks
- **Description**: Linux OS fundamentals, signal modulation, network architectures, and TCP/IP (OSI) model. Practical work included network traffic analysis with Wireshark, static routing, VLAN segmentation, and firewall configuration using Core Network Simulator.

## Introduction to Databases
- **Description**: Database design, modeling, and querying using Oracle SQL Database and Oracle Data Modeler, plus NoSQL databases through MongoDB. Covered both relational database theory and practical implementations.

## Foundations of Computing
- **Description**: Core mathematical models including Graph Theory, Tree Structures, Propositional & Predicate Logic, Probability, Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Statistics. All work completed using Python in Jupyter Notebook.

## Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence
- **Description**: Introduction to AI concepts including Intelligent Agents, Adversarial Search, Bayesian Networks, and Machine Learning fundamentals.
