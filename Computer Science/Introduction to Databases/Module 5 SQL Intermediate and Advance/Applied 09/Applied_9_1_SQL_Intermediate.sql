-- 12 A unit offering is an instance of a particular unit in a particular semester - for example FIT1045 offered in semester 1 of 2019 - is a unit offering. 
-- All unit offerings are listed in the OFFERING table. Find the unit offering/s with the highest number of enrolments for any unit offering which occurred in
