    "A random variable may be defined as a real-valued function over a random experiment's sample space $S$. \n",
    "- The function's domain is $S$\n",
    "- The real numbers associated with the various possible outcomes of the random experiment constitute the range of the function\n",
    "\n",
    "Random variables are classified into two main categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Discrete Random Variable**:\n",
    "   - Range consists of a finite number or countable infinitude of values\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Continuous Random Variable**:\n",
    "   - Range consists of an uncountable infinitude of values\n",
