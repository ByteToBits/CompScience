    "### **Expectation of a Random Variable**\n",
    "\n",
    "The expected value or expectation of a random variable is the **average value** of the random variable. The expected value of a random variable $X$ is denoted by $E(X)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The expected value of a random variable can be interpreted as the long-run average of observations on the random variable. The procedure for calculating the expected value of a random variable depends on whether the random variable is discrete or continuous.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Discrete Random Variables**\n",
    "\n",
    "If $X$ is a **discrete random variable** with **probability distribution function (pdf)** specified by $f(x)$, then the expectation of a discrete random variable $X$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E[X] = \\sum_x x f(x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "or for a function $g(X)$ of the random variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E[g(X)] = \\sum_x g(x) f(x)$$\n",

    "#### **Continuous Random Variables**\n",

    "#### **Important Properties**\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the expectation of a random variable, the expectation of a function of a random variable $g(X)$ is a weighted average of the function over all possible values $X$ can take on, with each value being weighted according to the probability of observing it.\n",
