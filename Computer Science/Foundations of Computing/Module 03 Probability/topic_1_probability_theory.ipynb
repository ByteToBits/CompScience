    "Probability is a logical framework for quantifying uncertainty and randomness. The mathematical framework for probability is built around **Sets**. The **Sample Space** $S$ of an experiment is the set of a the possible outcomes o the experiment. The Sample Space of the Experiment can be set to be Finite or Infinite. \n",

The **Probability of an Event** was to count the number of ways the event could unfold and divide by the total number of possible outcomes as shown below. This is assumed the Sample Space if Finite and each event has an equal outcome.\n",
