    "Graph Theory is a mathematical structure used to model pairwise relations between objects using varios methods like Matrices. A Graph $G$ is mathematically represented as $G = (V, E)$ and is defined as a set of Vertices $(V)$ and a set of Edges $(E)$. It is simply a collection of points (vertices or nodes) connected by lines (called edges). Graphs can also be used to visualize and analyze relationships and can also be used to represent a map where buildings are nodes and streets are edges.\n",
