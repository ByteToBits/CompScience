    "### **Z-Tests: Statistical Inference for Normal Populations with Known Variance**\n",
    "\n",
    "A statistical hypothesis represents a claim or assumption about the parameters of a population distribution. We call it a hypothesis because its truth remains uncertain until tested. The fundamental challenge in hypothesis testing is creating a systematic method to evaluate whether observed sample data supports or contradicts our initial assumption about the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example: Testing Population Means When Variance is Known**\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a random sample $X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_n$ drawn from a normal distribution with unknown mean $\\mu$ but known variance $\\sigma^2$. Our goal is to evaluate the null hypothesis:\n",
    "\n",
    "$H_0: \\mu = \\mu_0$\n",
    "\n",
    "against the competing alternative hypothesis:\n",
    "\n",
    "$H_1: \\mu \\neq \\mu_0$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mu_0$ represents a specific value we want to test against.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Building the Test Statistic\n",
    "\n",
    "The sample mean $\\bar{X} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i}{n}$ serves as our natural estimator for the population mean $\\mu$. Intuitively, we should accept the null hypothesis $H_0$ when $\\bar{X}$ falls reasonably close to $\\mu_0$. This logic leads us to define a rejection region:\n",
    "\n",
    "$C = \\{X_1, \\ldots, X_n : |\\bar{X} - \\mu_0| > c\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $c$ represents a threshold value we need to determine.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Finding the Critical Threshold\n",
    "\n",
    "To construct a test with significance level $\\alpha$, we must choose $c$ such that the probability of Type I error equals $\\alpha$. This means finding $c$ where:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P_{\\mu_0}\\{|\\bar{X} - \\mu_0| > c\\} = \\alpha$\n",
    "\n",
    "The notation $P_{\\mu_0}$ indicates we calculate this probability assuming the null hypothesis is true (i.e., $\\mu = \\mu_0$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the null hypothesis, $\\bar{X}$ follows a normal distribution with mean $\\mu_0$ and variance $\\sigma^2/n$. Therefore, we can standardize using:\n",
    "\n",
    "$Z \\equiv \\frac{\\bar{X} - \\mu_0}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This standardized variable $Z$ follows a standard normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deriving the Decision Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "The condition $P_{\\mu_0}\\{|\\bar{X} - \\mu_0| > c\\} = \\alpha$ can be rewritten as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P\\left\\{|Z| > \\frac{c\\sqrt{n}}{\\sigma}\\right\\} = \\alpha$\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the symmetry of the standard normal distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "$2P\\left\\{Z > \\frac{c\\sqrt{n}}{\\sigma}\\right\\} = \\alpha$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we know that $P\\{Z > z_{\\alpha/2}\\} = \\alpha/2$ for a standard normal variable, we can set:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{c\\sqrt{n}}{\\sigma} = z_{\\alpha/2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving for $c$ gives us:\n",
    "$c = \\frac{z_{\\alpha/2}\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Two-Tailed Test Decision Framework**\n",
    "\n",
    "With our critical value established, the significance level $\\alpha$ test follows this decision rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reject** $H_0$ when $\\frac{\\sqrt{n}}{\\sigma}|\\bar{X} - \\mu_0| > z_{\\alpha/2}$\n",
    "- **Fail to reject** $H_0$ when $\\frac{\\sqrt{n}}{\\sigma}|\\bar{X} - \\mu_0| \\leq z_{\\alpha/2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach, testing $\\mu = \\mu_0$ against $\\mu \\neq \\mu_0$, is termed a **two-tailed test**. We consider both extremely large positive and negative deviations of the sample mean from $\\mu_0$ as evidence against our null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **One-Tailed Tests**\n",
    "\n",
    "When we specifically want to determine if the population mean is greater than or less than $\\mu_0$ (rather than simply different from it), we employ **one-tailed tests**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Upper-Tail Testing**\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider testing the directional hypothesis:\n",
    "\n",
    "$H_0: \\mu \\leq \\mu_0 \\text{ versus } H_1: \\mu > \\mu_0$\n",
    "\n",
    "Logic dictates that we should reject $H_0$ when our sample mean $\\bar{X}$ substantially exceeds $\\mu_0$. This leads to a rejection region:\n",
    "\n",
    "$C = \\{(X_1, \\ldots, X_n): \\bar{X} - \\mu_0 > c\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "To maintain a Type I error rate of $\\alpha$, we need the critical value $c$ to satisfy:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P_{\\mu_0}\\{\\bar{X} - \\mu_0 > c\\} = \\alpha$\n",
    "\n",
    "Using our standardization $Z = \\frac{\\bar{X} - \\mu_0}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}}$, which follows a standard normal distribution under $H_0$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P\\left\\{Z > \\frac{c\\sqrt{n}}{\\sigma}\\right\\} = \\alpha$\n",
    "\n",

    "### **T-Tests: Statistical Inference When Population Variance is Unknown**\n",
    "\n",
    "While z-tests are powerful when population variance is known, real-world scenarios often involve unknown variances. The t-test addresses this limitation by using sample variance to estimate the unknown population variance, making it one of the most practical tools in statistical inference.\n",
